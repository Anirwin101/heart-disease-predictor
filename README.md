# Heart Disease Risk Prediction Web Application

This project is a machine learning–based web application designed to estimate the risk of heart disease using clinical parameters. The application provides a user-friendly interface to input medical data and receive an estimated risk assessment.

## Purpose

The aim of this project is to demonstrate the practical application of machine learning in the healthcare domain. It is developed as a student research project to explore how predictive models can assist in early risk assessment and awareness.

## Features

- Machine learning–based heart disease risk prediction
- Web interface for real-time input and prediction
- Displays estimated risk probability
- Personalized results using user name
- Informational and disclaimer-supported output
- Contact page for developer communication

## Input Parameters

The model uses the following clinical parameters:

- Age
- Gender
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Serum Cholesterol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Resting ECG Results
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
- Exercise Induced Angina
- ST Depression (Oldpeak)
- Slope of ST Segment
- Number of Major Vessels
- Thalassemia

## Technology Stack

- Python
- Flask
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- HTML & CSS

## How It Works

1. The user enters clinical parameters through the web interface.
2. The input data is processed and passed to a trained machine learning model.
3. The model predicts the risk category and estimates the probability of heart disease.
4. The result is displayed in a clear and user-friendly format.
